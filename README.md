I have done this project for my educational purpose.
This is a Sales Dashboard project I worked on,
The goal was to build an interactive and insightful dashboard using Power BI, focusing on data visualization and analysis.

Features included-
 Dynamic visualizations – Sales trends, KPIs, and performance metrics
 Interactive filters – Drill-down insights for better analysis
 Data-driven decisions – Identifying key sales patterns and growth opportunities

This project helped me improve my Power BI skills, including DAX formulas, data modeling, and visualization techniques.
